# Final Integration Notes

Scene Setup:

AR Scene:
Add an AR Session Origin with an ARRaycastManager component.
Place an empty GameObject with the ARManager script.
Create the AR marker prefab (attach a collider and the ARContentMarker script) and assign it in the Inspector.
Include the ContentManager, LocationManager, and FirebaseManager in the scene.
Set up your UI panels for content details and messaging, and assign references in UIManager.
Firebase Configuration:

Import and configure the Firebase Unity SDK in your project.
Add the necessary configuration files (e.g., google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS).
Testing:

Test AR functionality on real devices to ensure GPS-based content retrieval and AR marker placement work as expected.
Verify that messaging functionality correctly writes messages to Firestore.
